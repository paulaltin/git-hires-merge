git-subline-merge
=================

An interactive Git merge driver which can resolve non-overlapping conflicts on individual or adjacent lines.


Introduction
------------
Git's default merge strategy will throw a conflict whenever two branches make changes to adjacent (or the same) lines. This is eminently sensible: when changes are made, neighboring lines are needed to give them context – simply merging changes when their context has also changed won't always give the desired result.

However, sometimes you wish that Git would just try to merge those conflicting lines anyway.

Enter `git-subline-merge`:

Installation
------------
* Step 1: place this script somewhere on your path

If you just want to run this script manually on conflicted files, then stop here - you're done.

Otherwise, if you want to use this script as a custom merge driver that Git will call automatically when a merge or rebase operation hits a conflict, then continue on:

* Step 2: add these lines to your `~/.gitconfig`: 

```
    [merge "git-subline-merge"] 
        name = An interactive merge driver for resolving sub-line conflicts
        driver = git-subline-merge %O %A %B %L %P
        recursive = binary
```

* Step 3: add this line to your git-attributes file (e.g. `$HOME/.config/git/attributes` or `$GIT_DIR/info/attributes`):

```
    * merge=git-subline-merge
```

__Note to Python 2 users:__ this script uses the `future` package for Python 2 compatibility.  If you don't have this package you may get an error when trying to run the script (`ImportError: No module named builtin`). To fix this, simply install the `future` package using e.g. `pip install future`.


Usage
-----

If you have set up `git-subline-merge` as a custom merge driver (see Installation), then you don't need to do anything - it will run automatically when a conflict happens during a merge or rebase.

To invoke `git-subline-merge` manually on a conflicted file, just type:

```
    git-subline-merge /path/to/file
```

The conflicted file must have been generated using the `diff3` conflictstyle (see note below), and with the current conflict marker size setting (see gitattributes documentation).


Features
--------
- Interactive resolution of conflicts on adjacent lines
- Interactive resolution of non-overlapping conflicts on individual lines
- Can be used automatically during merging/rebasing operations, or manually from the command line
- Word-level diff highlighting shows exactly what has changed on each branch
- Option to resolve manually using the default Git editor
- Environment variables to control which hunks are unlikely to be resolvable and should be skipped


A note on diff3
---------------
If you run this script manually on a conflicted file, you may encounter an error about "badly formatted conflicts found in file", with a suggestion to change your `conflictstyle` to `diff3`. What's that about?

By default, Git leaves the two new versions of a conflicted hunk in the file, surrounded by conflict markers `<<<<<<<`, `=======` and `>>>>>>>`. However, to figure out how to resolve the conflict it's often necessary to know the original version, to see what changes were made on each branch. This is what `diff3` does. Once you have `diff3` turned on, you will see a third section beginning with `|||||||` in each conflict, which shows the "common ancestor" version of the hunk. Since you often need the ancestor to determine what the correct merge is, this feature is so useful that a lot of people (including me) think it should be the default.

In any case, `git-subline-merge` needs the common ancestor version to resolve conflicts, so it can only be run manually on conflicted files which were created using `diff3`.

To enable the `diff3` conflictstyle, simply run this command

```
git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3
```


How does it work?
-----------------

The basic idea is quite straightforward – we want to try merging the conflicted hunk using the smallest possible context, i.e. the neighboring characters instead of the neighboring lines.

This is done using the simplest, most brute-force approach imaginable: we split the hunk up so that each character is on a separate line, then try to merge them, and then remove all the extra newline characters. If the merge still fails, it can only be because the changes overlap at the character level, in which case there's nothing we can do without human intervention.


Advanced options
----------------
In general, a sub-line merge is less likely to succeed the larger the conflicted hunk is, and the larger the difference in size between the original ('base') version and the two new versions ('current' and 'other').

If you find that `git-subline-merge` is stopping too often on conflicted hunks that it can't resolve, or skipping too many that it could have resolved, you can tune the `MAX_HUNK_SIZE` and `MAX_HUNK_SIZE_DIFF` constants to control which hunks are processed and which are skipped. These constants are found at the top of the script, or they can be set using environment variables `GIT_SUBLINE_MERGE_MAX_HUNK_SIZE` and `GIT_SUBLINE_MERGE_MAX_HUNK_SIZE_DIFF`.

The default values are `MAX_HUNK_SIZE = 16` and `MAX_HUNK_SIZE_DIFF = 8`, which means that conflicts spanning more than 16 lines, or whose versions differ by more than 8 lines, will be skipped. For example, a conflict which spans `12/14/14` lines in the current, base and other versions will be processed, but a conflict which spans `6/8/15` lines will be skipped.

The optimal values of these constants will depend on what kind of text you are merging, so the best thing to do is to experiment until you find values that work well for your situation.

If you are *really* confident that the subline merge will always do what you want, you can let `git-subline-merge` run automatically by setting `NON_INTERACTIVE_MODE` to `True` (or by setting the `GIT_SUBLINE_MERGE_NON_INTERACTIVE_MODE` environment variable). In this case, the script will try to merge conflicted hunks without asking for confirmation, leaving those that cannot be merged. However, this is strongly discouraged in most situations as it is likely to lead to erroneous merges. Use this only for predictable and repeatable conflicts which are known to merge successfully.


Tested with
-----------
- git version 2.15
- Python 2.7 and 3.8
- Mac OS X 10.12 - 10.15
- Linux
- Windows Subsystem for Linux


Known limitations
-----------------
- *Windows*: this script does not yet work properly on Windows (no fundamental problem, just the lack of a machine to debug it with).
- *Line endings*: this script will only work on files with *nix-style LF (\n) line endings.
